### Ingredients

- 9 cloves garlic
- 3/4 pound large shrimp, peeled and shells reserved
- scant 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- Pinch of paprika

- Splash sherry vinegar

### Instructions

1. Grate 3 garlic cloves and place in large bowl. Smash 3 cloves and place in a skillet. Thinly slice remaining 3 garlic cloves and set aside.
2. Add shrimp to bowl with grated garlic. Add about 3 tablespoons olive oil, kosher salt, baking soda, and paprika. Toss to coat shrimp and set aside.
3. Add shrimp shells to skillet with smashed garlic and add remaining olive oil and pepper flakes. Set over low heat and cook about 10 minutes. Oil should be gently bubbling the whole time.

# Chocolate Crinkle Cookies

Makes 22 cookies

## Ingredients

- 5 ounces all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 ounces unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 10 1/2 ounces brown sugar
- 3 eggs
- 4 teaspoons instant espresso powder
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 4 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- granulated sugar

## Instructions

1. Heat oven to 325Â°F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. Whisk flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in bowl.
3. Separately, whisk brown sugar, eggs, espresso powder, and vanilla together in large bowl.
4. Microwave chocolate and butter in bowl, stirring occasionally until melted.
5. Whisk chocolate mixture into wet ingredients until combined. Fold in dry ingredients until no dry streaks remain. Let dough sit at room temperature for 10 minutes.
6. Fill a shallow dish or plate with granulated sugar. Drop 1-2 tablespoon dough balls onto the sugar and roll to coat. Space evenly on prepared sheets.
5. Bake 1 sheet at a time until puffed, cracked, and edges have begun to set but centers are still soft, about 12 minutes, rotating halfway. Cookies should look raw between cracks and seem underdone.

Let cool completely on sheet before serving.

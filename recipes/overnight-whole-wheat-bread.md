# Overnight Whole Wheat Bread

From Ken Forkish's Flour Water Salt Yeast

## Ingredients

- 300 grams all-purpose flour
- 200 grams whole wheat flour
- 400 grams water, 90-95°F
- 11 grams salt (about 2 teaspoons)
- 1.5 grams instant yeast (about 3/8 teaspoon)

## Instructions

1. Autolyse. Mix flour and water by hand until incorporated. Cover and let rest 30 minutes.
2. Mix. Sprinkle salt and yeast evenly over top of dough. Wet your hand, reach underneath dough, grab about a quarter, then gently stretch and fold it over top to other side of dough. Repeat several times until salt and yeast are enclosed. To fully mix ingredients, use your thumb and forefinger to make pincer cuts through dough. Then fold dough over itself a few times. Repeat, cutting and folding until ingredients are well mixed and dough has some tension to it. Let dough rest for a few minutes, then fold another 30 seconds or until dough tightens up. Target dough temp at this point is 77-78°F. Cover and let rise.
3. [Fold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQHuWDEo3SA). Dough needs 4 folds 30 minutes apart. Each time, wet your hand, reach underneath dough, grab about a quarter, then gently stretch and fold it over top to other side of dough. Repeat 4-5 times, then flip dough over and let it rest. Once all 4 folds are done, cover dough and let it rest 5 hours or until it's 3 times its original size.
4. [Shape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPdedk9gJLQ). Flour your hands and sprinkle flour around perimeter of dough ball. Tip container and gently work your floured hand underneath dough to loosen it. Gently ease dough out onto a floured countertop, being careful not to pull or tear it. Dust proofing basket or towel-lined bowl with flour. Keeping your hands in contact with dry, bottom part of dough, shape into a medium-tight ball, stretching and folding a quarter at a time up and over top to form a round. Flip it over so seam-side is on a relatively clean part of countertop. Cup your hands around back of dough ball, pull it 6-8 inches towards you, leading with your pinkys. Repeat, giving loaf a quarter turn each time, until you've gone around a few times and skin of loaf has some nice tension to it. Place loaf seam-side down in proofing basket, using sides of your hands to gently lift it and drop it in.
5. Proof. Lightly flour top of loaf. Put in a plastic bag and refrigerate overnight, 12-14 hours. Check if loaf is done proofing by poking it with a floured finger, making a 1/2 inch indentation. If it springs back immediately, it needs more time. If it springs back slowly and incompletely, loaf is proofed and ready to bake, straight from the fridge (no need to warm it up first).
6. Preheat. About 30 minutes before baking, put Dutch oven on a middle oven rack and preheat to 475°F.
7. Bake! Invert proofed loaf onto a lightly floured countertop. Take Dutch oven out, place loaf in seam-side up, cover, and put it in the oven. Bake 30 minutes, then uncover and bake for another 15-30 minutes until dark brown.

Take Dutch oven out, tilt out loaf, and let cool on a rack 20 minutes before slicing.

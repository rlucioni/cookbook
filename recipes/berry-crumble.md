## Ingredients

Crumble
- 160 grams all-purpose flour
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 cup white sugar
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into cubes and frozen
- 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 egg yolk
- 2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar

Filling
- 3 cups mixed berries
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 2 teaspoons corn starch
- 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F.
2. Mix flour, salt, baking powder, and sugar in a food processor. Add butter and process until mixture resembles coarse sand.
3. Transfer mixture to a mixing bowl. Add vanilla, egg yolk, and vinegar. Mix with a fork until mixture forms clumps when squeezed. Add more vinegar as necessary.
4. Mix berries, sugar, corn starch, lemon zest, and lemon juice in a bowl. Reserve.
5. Transfer half of the crumble mixture into a 8"x8" baking dish, or equivalent. Press down with the bottom of a glass.
6. Add berry mixture. Top with the rest of the crumble mixture by squeezing into large clumps and sprinkling over the berry layer.
7. Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until the top is golden-brown and the berries are bubbling.

Cool to room temperature before serving. Serve with vanilla ice cream.

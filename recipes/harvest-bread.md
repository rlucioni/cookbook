# Harvest Bread

## Ingredients

- 350 grams bread flour
- 153 grams whole wheat flour
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1/2 teaspoon instant yeast (3/4 teaspoon active dry)
- 397 grams water
- 85 grams dried cranberries
- 85 grams golden raisins
- 113 grams pecans or walnuts, coarsely chopped

## Instructions

1. Mix flour, salt, yeast, and water in a large bowl. Make sure to incorporate all the flour. Work in fruits and nuts. Cover bowl and let rise at room temperature overnight.
2. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and shape it into a loaf that'll fit in whatever you're baking it in (e.g., 10" pot with lid). Lightly grease pot and drop in the dough, smooth side up. Cover and let rise at room temperature for 2 hours.
3. Slash the bread, put the lid back on, and put the pot in a cold oven. Heat to 450°F. Bake 50 minutes, starting the timer when you put the bread in the cold oven. Then remove lid and bake until bread is dark brown and registers 205°F in the center, about 5-15 minutes.

Remove bread from the oven, turn out onto a rack, and cool completely before slicing.

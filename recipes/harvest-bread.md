# Harvest Bread

## Ingredients

- 300 grams bread flour
- 200 grams whole wheat flour
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1/2 teaspoon instant yeast (3/4 teaspoon active dry)
- 400 grams water
- 80 grams dried cranberries
- 80 grams golden raisins
- 120 grams pecans or walnuts, coarsely chopped

## Instructions

1. Mix flour, salt, yeast, and water in a large bowl. Make sure to incorporate all the flour. Work in fruits and nuts. Cover bowl and let rise at room temperature overnight.
2. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and shape it into a loaf that'll fit in whatever you're baking it in (e.g., 10" pot with lid). Try to avoid having fruit or nut bits exposed on the surface. Lightly grease pot and cover the bottom with parchment and cornmeal, making sure to get the corners. Drop in the dough, smooth side up. Cover and let rise at room temperature for 2 hours.
3. Heat oven to 450°F. Slash the bread, put the lid back on, and bake 40 minutes. Remove lid and bake until bread is dark brown and registers 205°F in the center, about 5-15 minutes.

Remove bread from the oven, turn out onto a rack, and cool completely before slicing. Serve with salted butter and jam.

# Mayonnaise

Makes about 1 1/2 cups

## Ingredients

- 1 egg yolk
- 4 teaspoons white wine vinegar and/or lemon juice
- 1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon sugar
- 1 1/2 cups vegetable oil

## Instructions

1. Process or whisk egg yolk, vinegar and/or lemon juice, mustard, salt, and sugar until light and frothy.
2. Process or whisk while slowly drizzling in oil until emulsified and mixture is thick. If the emulsion breaks - it happens to everyone - whisk together another yolk with more mustard and vinegar in a clean bowl, then keep whisking while slowly drizzling in the broken emulsion and any remaining oil.

Mayonnaise can be refrigerated for up to 1 week. Don't substitute olive oil for vegetable oil or the mayonnaise will be bitter. Make [aioli](garlic-aioli.md) instead!

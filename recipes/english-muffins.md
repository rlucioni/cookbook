# English Muffins

## Ingredients

- 400 grams lukewarm milk
- 3 tablespoons butter, softened
- 1 1/4 teaspoons salt
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten
- 540 grams bread flour
- 3 teaspoons active dry yeast
- semolina

## Instructions

1. Combine all ingredients except semolina in a mixing bowl. Beat in a stand mixer using the paddle attachment until it starts coming away from the sides of the bowl, about 5 minutes at medium-high speed. Scrape dough into a rough ball and cover the bowl. Let rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours.
2. Sprinkle 2 non-stick or cast iron pans with semolina. Deflate dough and divide into 16 pieces. Shape each piece into a smooth ball, then flatten until they're about 3" in diameter. Proof in pans for 20 minutes.
3. Cook muffins on low heat until golden brown, about 10 minutes per side. Insides should register 200°F. If the outsides are getting dark but they aren't done yet, finish in the oven at 350°F for about 10 minutes.

Let muffins cool before serving.

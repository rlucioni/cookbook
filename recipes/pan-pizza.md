# Pan Pizza

## Ingredients

Dough (2 10" pizzas):
- 400 grams bread flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon instant yeast
- 275 grams water
- 8 grams extra-virgin olive oil

Toppings:
- [pizza sauce](pizza-sauce.md)
- grated full-fat, low-moisture mozzarella cheese
- toppings as desired (e.g., pepperoni, pineapple and Canadian bacon)

## Instructions

1. Combine dough ingredients in a large bowl. Mix until dough ball comes together and no dry flour is left. Let rise overnight in the refrigerator and at least 4 hours afterwards at room temperature.
2. Split dough into two equal pieces. They can be used now or frozen for later use.
3. Add a tablespoon of olive oil to a 10" cast iron skillet. Place a dough ball in the center and use your hands to push it down into a disc. Cover and let rise for 2 hours.
4. Preheat oven to 500Â°F, or as high as the oven will go.
5. Push dough to fill all corners of the pan and deflate any large bubbles. Lift dough edges to release any bubbles underneath.
6. Top with sauce, cheese, and any toppings. Bake for 20 minutes.

Top with fresh basil.

# Lobster Rolls

Yields 3

## Ingredients

- 3 lobsters, around 1 1/3 pounds each
- 3 New England style hot dog buns (AKA split-top buns)
- 1 tablespoon mayonnaise
- 1/2 rib celery, finely diced
- Old Bay, to taste
- 1 1/2 tablespoons butter

## Instructions

1. Bring an inch of water to a boil in a large pot.
2. Steam lobsters one at a time, 7 minutes per pound. Watch for boilovers!
3. Remove meat from shells and cut into large chunks. Pro tip: use a rolling pin to extract meat from legs.
4. Mix in mayonnaise, celery, and Old Bay. Refrigerate 10-15 minutes.
5. Remove some bread from the inside of the buns to make a cavity. Toast buns in a pan with melted butter until golden brown.
6. Fill with lobster mixture.

Serve with french fries and a cold beer.

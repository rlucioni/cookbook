# Eggy Wraps

## Ingredients

- 4 flour tortillas
- 3 eggs, beaten and lightly salted
- grated cheese, ham, and other fillings, divided into 4 portions

## Instructions

1. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.
2. Pour a quarter of the egg mixture into the pan. Swirl to coat the pan evenly.
3. Place a tortilla on top of the egg. Wait 10-20 seconds until the egg has solidified onto the tortilla.
4. Flip everything such that the tortilla is contacting the pan and the egg is facing up. Place fillings in the center third and fold over both sides.
5. Drizzle a few drops of vegetable oil into the pan and tilt to soak into the bottom of the wrap. Cook until bottom is crispy.
6. Repeat with remaining ingredients.

Serve with salsa and sour cream.

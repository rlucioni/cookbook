- 1 generous cup kimchi, drained and chopped (save 1/4 cup of the juice)
- 1 cup ham, diced
- 1 tablespoon gochujang
- 3 generous cups cooked rice
- soy sauce
- 1/2 cup sliced green onion
- 2-3 garlic cloves, grated
- 2 teaspoons sesame seeds, toasted
- 2 teaspoons sesame oil
- [fried eggs](fried-eggs.md)
- nori

## Instructions

1. Saute onions in vegetable oil in a nonstick pan or wok until they start to soften.
2. Add kimchi and ham. Saute for a while. Mix in gochujang.
3. Add rice. Sprinkle soy sauce and kimchi juice over the rice. Fry the rice, pressing it down and turning it over every once in a while to reincorporate crispy bits, like making hash browns.

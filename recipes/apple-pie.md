# Apple Pie

For a 9.5" pie

## Ingredients

- 2 batches of [pie crust](pie-crust.md)
- 4-4 1/2 pounds apples (8 apples: 4 honeycrisp, 2 golden delicious, 2 granny smith, or similar combination)
- 1 lemon, zested and juiced
- 1/2 cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
- heavy cream
- demerara sugar

## Instructions

1. Adjust oven rack to lowest possible position, put a foil-lined baking sheet in, and preheat to 500°F.
2. Roll out one batch of pie crust, put it in the pie plate, and refrigerate.
3. Peel, quarter, and core apples. Mandoline into very thin slices.
4. Combine apples with lemon zest, lemon juice, sugar, flour, salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Toss to coat. Making a clamshell out of 2 large bowls works well.
5. Fill pie plate with apple mixture and any juices. Mound it slightly in the center. Cover with second rolled out crust, trimming overhang to about 1/2". Crimp crusts together. Brush with cream and sprinkle with sugar. Cut 4 2" slits.
6. Place on preheated baking sheet, lower oven temperature to 425°F, and bake until crust is light brown, about 25 minutes. Lower oven temperature to 375°F and bake until crust is deep brown, about 35 minutes more.

Let cool on wire rack and chill before slicing.

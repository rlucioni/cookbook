# Roasted Beets

## Ingredients

- 1 bunch beets (about 2 pounds), greens removed leaving about 1" of stems and washed

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F.
2. Put beets on a foil-lined baking sheet. Rub with olive oil and salt. Roast until they can be easily pierced with a knife, about 1 hour.

Cool slightly, remove skins, cut, and serve. Roasted beets don't bleed as much when cut!

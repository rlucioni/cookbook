# Ciabatta

Yields 4 loaves

## Ingredients

- 500 grams bread flour
- 10 grams salt
- 13.5 grams active dry yeast

## Instructions

1. Combine flour, salt, and yeast in a freestanding mixer with 330 grams cold water. Knead with dough hook on speed 2.
2. As dough comes together, drizzle in another 110 grams cold water. Knead 2 minutes at a time until dough is smooth and stretchy, 4-6 minutes total.
3. Lightly oil a square container. Tip in dough and seal. Let rest until doubled in size, about 1.5 hours at room temperature.
4. Dust baking sheet and work surface with flour and/or semolina. Tip dough out of container. Try to keep as much air in dough as possible. Top with more flour and/or semolina.
5. Slice dough into 4 loaves, stretching each out a bit before transferring to baking sheet. Proof 30 minutes.
6. Preheat oven to 425Â°F. Bake until loaves are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped, about 25 minutes.

Let cool completely before slicing.

# Roasted Chicken with Gravy

Adapted from Julia Child's roasted chicken recipe, from [Cooking with Master Chefs](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679748296).

## Ingredients

- 5 pound whole roasting chicken, rinsed
- 1 lemon, halved
- 4 sprigs thyme
- 2 sprigs rosemary
- 6 cloves garlic, crushed
- salt and black pepper
- olive oil
- chicken stock (about 1/2 cup)
- flour (about 1 generous tablespoon)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400°F.
2. Add the lemon juice, juiced lemon halves, thyme, rosemary, garlic, salt, and pepper to a large mixing bowl. Stir to combine.
3. Toss chicken in the prepared marinade. Salt and pepper the cavity, then stuff with the marinade.
4. Place the chicken in a cast-iron skillet, tucking in the nubbins. Pour juices from the bowl over the chicken. Rub with a generous amount of olive oil and sprinkle with a generous amount of salt.
5. Roast until internal temperature reaches 145°F, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Check after an hour and tent the breasts with foil if they're getting dark.
6. Move chicken to a plate, place pan over low heat, and add enough chicken stock and flour to form a gravy.

Serve with rice, potatoes, peas, green beans.

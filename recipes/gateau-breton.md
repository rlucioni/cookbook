# Gateau Breton

## Ingredients

### Filling

- 2/3 cup water
- 1/2 cup dried California apricots, chopped
- 1/3 cup sugar
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice

### Cake

- 16 tablespoons (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 6 egg yolks, 1 of which should be beaten separately with water for egg wash
- 2 tablespoons dark rum
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 10 ounces flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Blend water and apricots until pureed. Transfer to skillet and stir in sugar. Cook over medium heat until puree darkens and thickens. You should be able to see the bottom when dragging a spoon through. Add lemon juice and refrigerate until cool, about 15 minutes.
2. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Grease 9-inch round cake pan.
3. Cream butter and sugar. Work in 5 egg yolks. Mix in rum and vanilla. Mix in flour and salt until flour is just incorporated.
4. Spread half of batter into even layer in the bottom of the pan. Freeze 10 minutes to harden.
5. Spread about 1/2 cup of filling in even layer over chilled batter, leaving 1/2 inch border around edge. Freeze another 10 minutes.
6. Spread remaining batter over filling. Brush with egg wash and score surface with the tines of a fork to make a diamond pattern.
7. Bake until golden brown and edges of cake start to pull away from sides of pan, about 45-50 minutes. Let cool in pan about 30 minutes, then run a knife along side of pan to remove cake.

Let cool completely before serving.

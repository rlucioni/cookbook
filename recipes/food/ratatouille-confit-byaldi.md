# Ratatouille Confit Byaldi

Adapted from the [New York Times' Confit Byaldi](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/dining/131rrex.html). Fills one 10" pan.

For the piperade (makes enough for two 10" ratatouilles):
- 1/2 yellow bell pepper
- 1/2 orange bell pepper
- 1/2 red bell pepper
- 1/2 yellow onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, grated
- 4 San Marzano tomatoes, canned
- 1 sprig thyme
- 1 bay leaf

For the vegetables:
- 1 zucchini
- 1 yellow squash
- 1 japanese eggplant
- 4 roma tomatoes

For the vinaigrette:
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
- 1 tablespoon reserved piperade

1. Preheat the oven to 450&deg;F.
2. When oven is heated, roast peppers skin side up for 15 minutes, or until skin loosens. Transfer to a bowl and cover to steam the peppers.
3. Cook the onion and garlic in a 10" oven-proof skillet over low heat until very soft but not browned.
4. Add canned tomatoes, thyme, and bay leaf and cook on low until all the liquid has evaporated.
5. While the piperade is cooking, boil the roma tomatoes for 1 minutes before removing to an ice bath. Peel the tomatoes.
6. Peel the peppers and chop. Add to the onion and tomato mixture and cook a few minutes.
7. Blend mixture well and add half (minus a tablespoon) back into the bottom of the 10" skillet.
8. Use a serated knife to slice the tomatoes as thinly as possible. Do the same for the eggplant.
9. Use a mandolin to slice the zucchini and squash.
10. Shingle the vegetables into the 10" pan on top of the piperade. There may be vegetables left over.
11. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle over salt, pepper, and thyme leaves.
11. Heat oven to 275&deg;F. Cover ratatouille with a circle of parchment paper and bake for 90 minutes.
12. Remove parchment paper and bake an additional 30 minutes uncovered.
13. Let cool to room temperature before serving. Alternatively, chill and serve the next day.
14. Mix together olive oil, vinegar, and a tablespoon of the piperade. Drizzle on top of the ratatouille before serving.

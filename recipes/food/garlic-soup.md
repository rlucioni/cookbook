# Garlic Soup

Adapted from [Chef John's garlic soup](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2013/04/celebrating-national-garlic-day-with.html). Serves 2.

- About 6 cups of cubed French or Italian bread
- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, plus more to drizzle on bread cubes
- 6-10 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- 2 ounces ham, diced
- 1-2 teaspoon paprika or to taste
- 6 cups chicken broth
- 1/4 cup chopped Italian parsley
- Salt, pepper, cayenne to taste
- 4 large eggs

1. Toast bread cubes coated in olive oil at 350&deg;F until golden brown, about 15-20 minutes.
2. Heat olive oil over medium heat until it shimmers. Add garlic and toast until barely brown.
3. Add ham and warm through, then add paprika and toast for a few seconds. Add bread and toss to coat in paprika-infused oil.
4. Add chicken broth and bring to a boil, then reduce to medium. Add parsley and season with salt, pepper, and cayenne.

Serve with poached eggs. To prepare each egg, fill a ramekin halfway with water, add a dash of white vinegar, slide in an egg, and microwave on high for 45-60 seconds.

## Ingredients

- 2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs, patted dry and cut into 2-inch chunks
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 1/2 teaspoons cumin
- 1 teaspoon coriander
- 2 teaspoons paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne
- 2 teaspoons garam masala
- 3/4 cup whole roasted cashews
- 2 cups cold water
- 2 tablespoons butter, cut in half
- 1 yellow onion, chopped
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 4 garlic cloves, grated
- 1 tablespoon ginger, grated
- 1 cup chicken stock
- 1/3 cup green onions, sliced
- 1/3 cup cilantro, chopped
- lime

## Instructions

1. Mix spices. Mix vegetable oil and about half of spice blend with chicken. Marinate 4 hours to overnight.
2. Add cashews and water to a blender. Blend well on high speed. Reserve.
3. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in pan over high heat. As soon as foam starts to turn golden brown, add chicken in a single layer. Sear about 5 minutes, then turn and sear other side 4-5 minutes. Reserve to original bowl.
4. Add remaining butter to the pan over medium high heat. Add onion, remaining spice blend, tomato paste, garlic, and ginger. Cook 2-3 minutes to take raw edge off onions and toast spices. Add chicken stock. When it starts bubbling, stir in chicken and any juices. Stir in cashew cream, reduce heat to medium, and simmer until chicken is done and sauce is reduced, 20-45 minutes.
5. Stir in green onions and cilantro. Taste for seasoning.

Serve over rice with lime, or with [garlic naan](garlic-naan.md).

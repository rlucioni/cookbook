# Canelé

Adapted from [Chef John's canelé](https://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2017/10/caneles-de-bordeaux-crispy-baked-french.html).

## Ingredients

- 160 grams bread flour
- 1 cup sugar
- 4 egg yolks
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 cup rum
- 2 cups whole milk
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus extra for brushing pan

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375&deg;F on convection.
2. Mix flour, sugar, egg yolks, salt, vanilla extract, and rum in a bowl.
3. Bring milk and butter to a simmer over medium-high heat. Whisk into mixed ingredients in two additions to form a thin, smooth batter.
4. Prep muffin pan by brushing generously with melted butter. Evenly portion batter into the greased pan.
5. Bake until very well browned, about 45 minutes. Immediately invert each canelé onto a cooling rack to prevent sticking and to help them crisp up.

Let cool completely before eating.

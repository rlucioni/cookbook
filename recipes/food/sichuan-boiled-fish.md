# Sichuan Boiled Fish

Adapted from [The Woks of Life's Sichuan Boiled Fish](http://thewoksoflife.com/2017/02/sichuan-boiled-fish-shui-zhu-yu).

### Ingredients

- 1 pound fish fillets (e.g., tilapia, catfish, flounder)
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper
- 2 tablespoons Shaoxing rice wine (or dry sherry)
- 1 egg white
- 1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, plus an additional 1/2 cup
- 4 cups chicken stock
- 1 cup water
- 5 slices ginger
- 3 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced
- Napa cabbage, coarsely chopped strips
- 2 scallions, coarsely chopped
- 3/4 pound soybean sprouts
- 15 grams dried red chili peppers, de-seeded and chopped
- 10 grams green Sichuan peppercorns

### Instructions

1. Cut the fish into 1/4-inch thick slices at a 45-degree angle. Your goal is to cut pieces of fish with a lot of surface area; theyâ€™ll shrink when cooked.
2. Mix salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and 1 tablespoon rice wine. Add egg white, mix, then incorporate cornstarch. Add fish slices and drizzle vegetable oil over the top. Marinate in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.
3. In a skillet or wok over high heat, add chicken stock, water, ginger, garlic, scallions, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and 1 tablespoon rice wine. Bring to a boil and add salt to taste.
4. Add bean sprouts and bring back to a boil. Cook for 1 minute, then use a spider or strainer to fish out the solids.
5. In a small pot, heat 1/2 cup oil. It's hot enough if you dip a chopstick in and see ðŸŽ¶tiny bubblesðŸŽ¶ forming.
6. While the oil heats, bring the soup back to a boil and then add the marinated fish. Once it returns to a boil, pour it over the vegetables in a heat-proof serving bowl.
7. Quickly sprinkle the dried chili peppers and the green Sichuan peppercorns evenly over the fish, and pour the heated oil evenly over everything. The oil should be hot enough to sizzle the chili and the peppercorns, but not hot enough to burn the spices.

Serve immediately!

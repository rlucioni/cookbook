# Lemon Poppy Seed Pancakes

Adapted from [Allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/214498/sunday-morning-lemon-poppy-seed-pancakes/).

## Ingredients

- 3/4 cup whole milk
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 170 grams flour
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon poppy seeds
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- 1 egg
- 2 tablespoons melted butter
- 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon lemon extract

## Instructions

1. Mix milk and lemon juice in a bowl and set aside.
2. Whisk together dry ingredients, including poppy seeds and lemon zest, in a large bowl.
3. Whisk egg, butter, vanilla, and lemon extract into the milk mixture. Add to the dry ingredients and mix until just combined.
4. Let batter rest for about 10 minutes.
5. Preheat a nonstick pan on medium-high heat. To test if the pan is hot enough, add a few drops of water to the pan. The water should dance across the surface. If the droplets evaporate immediately, the pan is too hot. Turn heat down to medium-low.
6. Ladle 1/4 of the batter into the center of the pan. Flip when bubbles begin to set around the edges. Repeat with the remaining batter.

Serve with warm syrup and butter.

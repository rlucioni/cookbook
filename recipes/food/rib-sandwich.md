# Rib Sandwich

## Ingredients

- 1 rack baby back pork ribs
- [dry rub](dry-rub.md)
- 1/2 cup barbecue sauce
- 1 cup [mustard slaw](mustard-slaw.md)
- 4 rolls or buns

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325&deg;F.
2. Lay ribs on a foil-lined baking sheet. Leave the membrane on; it'll help hold things together later. Season meat generously with dry rub.
3. Flip ribs membrane-side down and top with parchment paper. Wrap foil up and over the parchment around the outside of the pan. Top everything with another piece of foil, sealing around the edges of the pan.
4. Bake until meat is tender enough to easily push out bones, about 2 hours.
5. Unwrap, let cool slightly, then push out bones, checking for bone fragments as you do.
6. Let rest, then cut in half or quarters. Paint with BBQ sauce and optionally broil until sauce caramelizes, about 1 minute per side. If grilling to finish, refrigerate until cold, then cut, paint, and grill 3-4 minutes per side.
7. Brush meat and buns with a little extra sauce, then make sandwich with meat and mustard slaw.

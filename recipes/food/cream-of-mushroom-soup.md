# Cream of Mushroom Soup

Adapted from [Chef John's cream of mushroom soup](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2009/12/cream-of-mushroom-soup-pure-liquid-moon.html). Serves 4.

## Ingredients

- Generous drizzle of olive oil
- 2 pounds white or brown button mushrooms, sliced
- 1 yellow onion, diced
- 1 rounded tablespoon flour
- 6 sprigs fresh thyme
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled
- 4 cups chicken stock or water
- 1 cup heavy cream
- salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Combine olive oil, mushrooms, and a big pinch of salt in a pot over medium-high heat. Cook until all the liquid has come out of the mushrooms and evaporated, about 10 minutes.
2. When the mushrooms are golden brown, add onions.
3. Once onions are translucent, add flour. Cook flour for a few minutes to take off the raw edge.
4. Add thyme, garlic, chicken stock, and water. Simmer for an hour.
5. Puree. Stir in cream. Thin out with water if too thick. Season to taste.

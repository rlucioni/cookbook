Adapted from [Chef John's deviled eggs](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2012/01/recipe-666-deviled-eggs-damn-these-were.html). Recipe is for 12 eggs.

- 12 eggs
- 2 tablespoons cream cheese
- 1/3 cup mayonnaise
- 1/2 teaspoon Sriracha
- 1 teaspoon rice vinegar
- 2 teaspoons dijon mustard

1. Put eggs in large pot and cover with cold water to cover at least 1 inch. Bring to simmer over high heat.
2. As soon eggs start to bounce, remove from heat and cover. Let sit for 17 minutes.
3. Cool eggs under cold water. Peel the eggs and slice them in half. Remove yolks to a bowl.
4. Mash yolks with cream cheese, mayonnaise, Sriracha, and mustard.
5. Stir in vinegar, salt, and pepper to taste.
6. Pipe filling into egg white halves.

Many topping options: chives, paprika, bacon bits, and/or pickled peppers.

For pickled peppers, heat 3 tablespoons water with 3 tablespoons of sugar. Pour hot syrup over pepper (cut into rings).

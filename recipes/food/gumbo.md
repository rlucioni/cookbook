## Instructions

1. In a pressure cooker over medium heat, melt butter, then add oil and flour. Cook, stirring constantly, until the roux is a dark, caramel color, almost like melted chocolate.
2. Add onion, bell pepper, and celery. Cook until softened.
3. Stir in sausage, spices, and bay leaf. Add okra and garlic, then tomatoes and stock. Cook at high pressure for 10 minutes. Let sit off the heat for 20 minutes to release pressure naturally.
4. Add Worcestershire sauce, rice vinegar, and shrimp. Simmer until shrimp is pink and cooked through. Taste for seasoning.

Serve over rice.

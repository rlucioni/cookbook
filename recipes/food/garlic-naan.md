# Garlic Naan

Yields 6 naan.

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup water, warmed
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 package dry active yeast
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 2 cloves garlic, grated
- 1/4 cup plain yogurt
- 2 cups bread flour
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- cilantro, chopped

## Instructions

1. Mix water, sugar, and yeast in a bowl. Let sit for 15 minutes to confirm yeast is alive.
2. While waiting, make garlic butter. Melt butter in a pan over medium heat. When it starts sizzling, quickly stir in garlic and turn off heat.
3. Add yogurt, flour, salt, and 1 tablespoon of garlic butter to yeast bowl. Mix until a shaggy dough forms. Press together and knead until it pulls away from sides and a rough ball forms.
4. Knead 3-4 minutes until dough is smooth, elastic, and springs back to the touch.
5. Return to bowl, coat with more garlic butter, then cover and let rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours.
6. Punch down dough, press into rectangular shape, and cut into 6 equal pieces. Use cupped hand to roll into balls. Lightly dust with flour, cover, and proof for 20 minutes.
7. Roll out into ovals on a floured surface.
8. Cook in an extremely hot, dry cast iron skillet, 2-3 minutes per side. Gently press after flipping to help char marks form.
9. Remove from pan and brush with garlic butter. Garnish with cilantro and some coarse salt.

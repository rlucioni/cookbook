### Ingredients

- 2 1/2 cups [dashi](dashi.md)
- 2 tablespoons lemongrass, thinly sliced, from the bottom third
- 1 tablespoon galangal or ginger, peeled and julienned
- 1 cup oyster mushrooms, chopped
- 1 habanero or Thai bird chili, seeds removed and thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup fish sauce
- 1/4 cup lime juice
- 1 pound catfish fillets (US farm-raised), cut into 1-inch chunks
- 14 ounces coconut milk
- 1 tablespoon cilantro

### Instructions

1. Bring dashi to a simmer in a pot over medium-high heat.
2. Add the lemongrass, galangal, mushrooms, habanero, fish sauce, and lime juice. Return to a simmer.
3. Add the catfish and coconut milk. Simmer until fish is just cooked through - barely opaque and firm - about 4 to 5 minutes. Don't boil it!
4. Stir in cilantro. Taste for seasoning. Be careful with the salt. The fish sauce is salty.

Remove from the heat, ladle into soup bowls, and serve immediately.

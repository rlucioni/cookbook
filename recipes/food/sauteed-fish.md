# Sauteed fish

Serves 2.

## Ingredients

- 4 slices ginger
- 1 Thai bird chili, roughly chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
- 2 filets fish, skin on (salmon, branzini, and red snapper work well)
- 2 scallions, cut into 1 inch pieces
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon sake

## Instructions

1. Heat vegetable oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add ginger and chilis. Sizzle for 30 seconds. Add garlic and cook for another 30 seconds before adding filets, skin side down, and scallions.

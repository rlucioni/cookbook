Adapted from [Cooking with Dog's ramen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfEUwNQTXwU). Serves 2.

Pork broth
- 1 pound pork belly
- 2-3 stalks green onion, cut into thirds
- 1 small piece of ginger, crushed
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- 4 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons sake
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar

Dashi stock
- 5 cups water
- 2x4 inch dried kombu kelp
- 1 large handful bonito flakes

Toppings
- chopped green onions
- blanched spinach
- blanched mung bean sprouts
- soft-boiled eggs
- toasted nori seaweed

1. Cut pork rib in half and sear pieces on high heat in small saucepan. Use a paper towel to remove excess fat.
2. Add enough water or chicken stock to cover. Add green onion, ginger, and garlic. Simmer for 1-2 hours, skimming fat occasionally.
3. Add 5 cups of water to a stock pot. Add dried kombu kelp and soak for 1-2 hours.
4. Remove pork belly and allow to cool. Strain pork broth before returning to heat. Add soy sauce, sake, and sugar. Boil until reduced to 1 1/4 cups.
5. Bring water with kombu to a boil and remove kelp when small bubbles start to form. Add bonito flakes and boil for 30 seconds. Strain and reserve. 
6. Blanch spinach and bean sprouts. Soft-boil and peel eggs. Cut pork into slices and place under broiler until golden brown.
7. Boil ramen noodles according to package instructions. Remove and place in bowls.
8. Add equal parts pork broth and dashi stock. Add toppings and serve.

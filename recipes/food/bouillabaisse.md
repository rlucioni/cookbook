### Ingredients

Fish stock
- 1 whole red snapper (between 2 and 2 1/2 pounds)
- 20 ounces bone-in halibut steak
- 3 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1/4 cup dry white wine
- 7 cups water
- 2 teaspoons black peppercorns

Bouillabaisse
- 1 onion, diced
- 1 leek, diced
- 1 fennel bulb, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
- 14 1/2 ounces canned diced tomatoes
- 1/4 cup dry white wine
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 pinch saffron
- 2 strips orange peel
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 4 Yukon gold potatoes, cut into 1/2 inch cubes
- 2 dozen mussels, soaked in cold fresh water for 20 minutes to remove sand
- 1 pound shrimp
- meat from red snapper and halibut, cut into large chunks

### Instructions

1. Filet red snapper and reserve the meat. Repeat with the halibut steak. Break red snapper carcass into large pieces, remove any gills, and wash away any blood.
2. Heat olive oil in a pot on medium-high heat until it starts to shimmer. Add fish bones and garlic and sizzle for 1 minute. Add wine and cook until most of the alcohol has evaporated. Add water and peppercorns.
3. Simmer for 20 minutes, skimming any foam that rises to the top. Strain and reserve.
4. Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a pot on medium-high heat. Add onion, leek, and fennel and cook until translucent. Add garlic and cook an additional minute.
5. Add tomatoes and cook 5 minutes. Add wine, bay leaves, saffron, orange peel, reserved fish stock, olive oil, and cayenne pepper. Bring to a healthy simmer for 20 minutes.
6. Fish out and discard bay leaves and orange peels. Blend smooth with an immersian blender and pass through a fine-meshed strainer.
7. Bring broth back to a boil and add potatoes. Simmer for 10-15 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Remove potatoes with a spider to serving bowls.
8. Add mussels and cook until they all open (discarding any that don't open for a while). Remove to serving bowls.
9. Add shrimp and fish pieces and poach until barely cooked through. Remove to serving bowls.
10. Taste and adjust broth seasoning. Ladle over seafood.

Serve with [garlic bread](garlic-bread.md).

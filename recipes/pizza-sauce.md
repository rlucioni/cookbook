# Pizza Sauce

Adapted from [Serious Eats' New York Style Pizza Sauce](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/10/new-york-style-pizza-sauce.html). Yields enough sauce for 2-4 10-inch pizzas.

## Ingredients

- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, grated
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1/2 teaspoon marjoram
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- cayenne, to taste
- 1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1 anchovy fillet and/or crumbled Parmesan cheese
- 1 teaspoon honey
- splash of balsamic vinegar

## Instructions

1. Saute onion in olive oil with some salt until soft. Add garlic, oregano, basil, marjoram, black pepper, and cayenne. Cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant but not browned.
2. Add tomatoes and quickly puree with an immersion blender. Puree should not be completely smooth.
3. Add tomato paste, anchovy and/or parmesan, honey, and balsamic vinegar. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to lowest setting (bubbles should barely be breaking the surface), and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced by half, about 2 hours.

This recipe makes a lot of sauce. It freezes well!

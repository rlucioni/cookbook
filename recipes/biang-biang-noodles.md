# Biang Biang Noodles

Serves 2.

## Ingredients

### Noodles

- 300 grams flour
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 150 grams water
- vegetable oil

### The rest

- 2 cloves garlic, grated
- 2 scallions, chopped
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons Chinkiang black vinegar
- 2 tablespoons [chili oil](chili-oil.md)
- vegetables for topping (e.g., yu choy, bok choy)

## Instructions

1. Combine flour and salt in a mixing bowl. Slowly drizzle in water, mixing with hands. Knead until dough just comes together, about 1 minute. Cover and let rest 30 minutes.
2. Knead dough until smooth, about 2 minutes. Shape into a ball, roll into a log, and cut into 6 pieces. Pinch cut ends of each piece, then roll each into a log. Cover logs with oil in the bowl. Cover and let rest 2 hours.
3. Combine garlic, scallion whites, and soy sauce in a bowl. Microwave 45 seconds. Mix in remaining sauce ingredients. Portion into serving bowls.
4. Bring a pot of water to a boil. One at a time, roll out each log into a rectangle and use a chopstick to score the center. Grab the ends of the rectangle with your thumbs palms up, then biang against the counter while pulling until the noodle is about a meter long. Starting in the center, pull the noodle apart along the score line, leaving one end connected. Drop into boiling water and cook until it floats, about 1 minute. Fish out with a spider and move it to a bowl, tossing in sauce. Repeat!
5. Blanch vegetables and serve on top of the sauced noodles.

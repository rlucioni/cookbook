# Tang Yuan

## Ingredients

- glutinous rice flour (Erawan brand, if possible)
- black sesame seeds
- powdered sugar
- sesame oil

## Instructions

1. Make the filling. Toast the sesame seeds in the microwave until fragrant. Blend in a spice grinder. Mix with powdered sugar and sesame oil.
2. Make the dough. Mix rice flour with hot (but not boiling!) water, until it's the consistency of Play-Doh.
3. Start some water boiling in a pot. In the meantime, form the tang yuan by rolling a small piece of dough into a sphere. Use your thumb to shape the sphere into a cup. Add some filling and tamp it down with your finger. Pinch shut.
4. Use a toothpick to poke 2 holes in each tang yuan.
5. When the water reaches a boil, add the tang yuan. When the water returns to a simmer, add a splash of cold water. Do this 3 times. Remove pot from heat and cover for 2 minutes.

Serve in bowls with some of the water used to boil them, like a soup.

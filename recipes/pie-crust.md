# Pie Crust

Adapted from [America's Test Kitchen's vodka pie crust](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12852-christopher-kimballs-foolproof-pie-dough). Yields one crust.

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons vodka or other 80-proof liquor
- 2 tablespoons water
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
- 40 grams (1/4 cup) vegetable shortening
- 200 grams all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon sugar

## Instructions

1. Mix vodka and water. Put mixture in the freezer.
2. Put butter pieces and vegetable shortening in the freezer. Let it chill 10-15 minutes.
3. Blitz flour, salt, and sugar in a food processor.
4. Add the chilled butter and shortening. Process until texture resembles coarse crumbs or wet sand.
5. Dump crumbs into a bowl. Sprinkle over most of the chilled liquid mixture. Fold with a spatula until a dry, loose dough forms, adding the rest of the chilled liquid as necessary. Press it together with your hands and mold it into a disk on a piece of plastic wrap.

Refrigerate at least 30 minutes before using, or freeze for later use.

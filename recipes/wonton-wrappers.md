# Wonton Wrappers

Makes 40-50 wrappers.

## Ingredients

- 250 grams all-purpose flour
- 1 egg
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 cup water

## Instructions

1. Add all ingredients to a stand mixer. Mix by hand using the dough hook to start combining.
2. Knead with the stand mixer using the dough hook attachment for 4 minutes, stopping halfway through to gather any flour sticking to the sides of the bowl. Adjust the dough by adding either water or flour such that the resulting dough is dense, yet comes together.
3. Wrap dough in plastic and let rest for 30 minutes.
4. Split dough into 6 pieces. Working with one piece at a time, pass dough through a laminator at the widest setting. Fold the dough using a letter fold and pass through again at the widest setting. Continue to laminate until the dough has passed through the thinnest setting. You may have to occasionally flour both sides of the dough sheet to prevent tearing.
5. Cut dough sheet into 3.5-inch squares. Liberally dust each square with flour or cornstarch to prevent sticking. Keep a pile of trimmings to combine and roll out at the end. Repeat steps 4 and 5 with the remaining dough pieces.

Use immediately or freeze.

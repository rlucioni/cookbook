# Shrimp and Grits

Serves 4.

## Ingredients

Grits
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 cup cornmeal
- 2 cups whole milk
- 2 cups water

Shrimp
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 1/2 pounds extra-large shrimp, peeled and deveined, shells reserved
- 2 cups water
- 3 slices bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 1 garlic clove, grated
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper to taste
- 4 scallions, sliced

## Instructions

1. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add grits and cook, stirring often, until fragrant, about 3 minutes.
2. Add milk, water, and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and cook covered, whisking often, until thick and creamy, about 25 minutes.
3. Remove from heat, stir in remaining 2 tablespoons butter, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover and keep warm.
4. Meanwhile, melt 1 tablespoon butter in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add shrimp shells and cook until shells are toasted. Add water and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes.
5. Strain shrimp stock through a fine-mesh strainer and reserve.
6. Cook bacon in the now-empty skillet over medium-low heat until crisp. Reserve 1 tablespoon bacon fat in a small bowl. Increase heat to medium-high and stir in shrimp. Cook until shrimp are mostly cooked. Reserve in a bowl with grated garlic.
7. Heat reserved bacon fat in the skillet, stir in flour, and cook about 1 minute. Mix in shrimp stock. If the mixture is lumpy, pass through a fine-mesh strainer and return to the skillet. Add tomato paste and simmer 5 minutes.
8. Stir in shrimp and bacon mixture and cook until shrimp are cooked through. Turn off the heat and stir in lemon juice. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper.

Serve over grits topped with sliced scallions and extra lemon wedges on the side.

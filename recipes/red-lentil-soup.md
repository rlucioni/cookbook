# Red Lentil Soup

## Ingredients

### Soup

- 1 onion, chopped
- 3/4 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 4 cups water
- 2 cups water
- 1 1/2 cups red lentils, rinsed
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice (optional)

### Spiced butter

- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 1/2 teaspoons dried mint, crumbled

## Instructions

1. Saute onion with some salt and olive oil over medium heat until softened but not browned.
2. Add coriander, cumin, ginger, cinnamon, cayenne, and pepper. If you're skipping the spiced butter, add paprika, too. Cook until fragrant. Stir in tomato paste and garlic. Add chicken stock, water, and lentils. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until lentils are soft and half broken down, about 15 minutes.
3. Whisk soup vigorously until coarsely pureed, about 30 seconds. Stir in lemon juice and season to taste. Cover and keep warm.
4. To make the spiced butter, melt butter in small skillet. Remove from heat and stir in mint and paprika.

Ladle soup into bowls, drizzle each with spiced butter, and serve. Goes well with plain yogurt!

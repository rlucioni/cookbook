# Cheesy Garlic Knots

Makes 8.

## Ingredients

- 6-7 garlic cloves, minced
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup water, warmed
- 3/4 teaspoon active-dry yeast
- 180 grams all-purpose flour
- 2/3 teaspoon salt
- 6 ounces mozzarella cheese
- parmesan cheese, grated
- marinara sauce for dipping (optional)

## Instructions

1. Heat garlic, 1 tablespoon butter, and 1/2 teaspoon water in a nonstick skillet over low heat. Cook 5-10 minutes until fragrant and barely toasted. Remove from heat and melt in remaining 3 tablespoons butter.
2. Strain garlic butter through a fine-mesh strainer. Add the garlic solids to a large bowl and reserve the garlic butter.
3. Dissolve yeast in warmed water and mix in 2 teapoons garlic butter.
4. Add flour and salt to the bowl with the garlic solids. Stir in yeast mixture until combined. Knead on a floured surface until dough is supple and slightly sticky, about 10 minutes, kneading in more flour as necessary.
5. Cover lightly with garlic butter and let rise, covered, for 45 minutes in a warm oven.
6. Cut half of the mozzarella into 8 equal chunks. Grate the rest. Grease the bottom of a cast iron skillet with half of the remaining garlic butter.
7. Roll out dough into a 6"x8" rectangle. Cut into 8 1"-strips. Roll strips diagonally to get a twisted dough rope. Tie each rope into a knot around a chunk of mozzarella cheese and place in oiled skillet.
8. Cover with a plate and let proof in a warm oven for 20 minutes. Remove from oven and preheat oven to 500Â°F. Paint knots with garlic butter and bake for 6 minutes, or until set.
9. Paint with rest of garlic butter and top with grated cheeses. Bake for an additional 4 minutes, or until tops are golden brown.

Serve with marinara sauce on the side.

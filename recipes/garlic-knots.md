# Garlic Knots

Makes 8.

## Ingredients

- 6-7 garlic cloves, minced
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup water, warmed
- 3/4 teaspoon active-dry yeast
- 180 grams all-purpose flour
- 2/3 teaspoon salt
- 6 ounces mozzarella
- parmesan cheese, grated
- [marinara sauce](pizza-sauce.md) for dipping

## Instructions

1. Heat garlic, butter, and 1/2 teaspoon water over low heat. Cook 5-10 minutes until fragrant and barely toasted. Remove from heat and strain. Add garlic solids to a large bowl and reserve the garlic butter.
2. Dissolve yeast in warm water. Mix in 2 teaspoons garlic butter.
3. Add flour and salt to bowl with the garlic solids. Stir in yeast mixture until combined. Knead until dough is supple and slightly sticky, about 10 minutes.
4. Cover lightly with garlic butter and let rise, covered, for 45 minutes in a warm oven.
5. Cut half of the mozzarella into 8 equal chunks. Grate the rest. Grease the bottom of a cast iron skillet with half of the remaining garlic butter.
6. Roll out dough into a 6"x8" rectangle, then cut into 8 1"-strips. Roll strips diagonally to make twisted dough ropes. Tie each rope into a knot around a chunk of mozzarella and place in oiled skillet.
7. Cover and proof in a warm oven for 20 minutes. Remove from oven and preheat to 500Â°F. Paint knots with garlic butter and bake for 6 minutes.
8. Paint with rest of garlic butter and top with grated cheeses. Bake until tops are golden brown but before cheese burns on the bottom of the skillet, about 4 minutes.

Serve with marinara sauce on the side.

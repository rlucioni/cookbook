Serves 4.

## Ingredients

- 4 duck legs
- 4 inch piece of ginger, sliced
- 1 onion, quartered
- 5 cloves garlic, crushed
- 4 star anise pods
- (optional) 1 black cardamom pod, crushed
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 1/2 tablespoon oyster sauce
- 1 teaspoon brown sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon five-spice powder
- (optional) duck necks, wings, and/or bones
- 8-10 shitake mushrooms, stems removed
- 1 bunch cilantro, stems and leaves separated
- wheat noodles ([alkaline noodles](alkaline-noodles.md) work well)
- baby bok choy
- 2 scallions, chopped

## Instructions

1. Place duck legs skin side down in a pressure cooker and cook over medium heat until legs are browned and release easily from the bottom. Reserve legs and spoon out most of the duck fat. The crispy skin can be enjoyed now sprinkled with a bit of salt!
2. Cook ginger slices and onion in the remaining duck fat until darkened. Add garlic, star anise, and cardamom pod and cook a few seconds until fragrant.
3. Add soy sauce and oyster sauce and cook a few seconds before adding 8 cups of water. Stir in brown sugar and five-spice powder. Add reserved duck legs, any other duck pieces, mushrooms, and cilantro stems. Add in more water as necessary to cover all the duck.
4. Bring to high pressure and cook for 25 minutes. Turn off heat and allow pressure to come back down naturally.
5. Start boiling water in a kettle.
6. Open the pressure cooker and reserve the duck pieces and shitake mushrooms. Optionally, pick all the duck meat from the bones.
7. Skim most of the fat and strain the broth through a paper towel-lined strainer, which should separate out most of the remaining fat. Season broth to taste and serve into bowls.
8. Add boiling water to the empty pressure cooker pot. Blanch bok choy and boil noodles. Add noodles to bowls of broth and top with duck meat, shitake mushrooms, bok choy, scallions, and cilantro leaves.

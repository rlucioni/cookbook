# Ratatouille

## Ingredients

- 4 bell peppers (red, yellow, or orange), halved
- 2 yellow onions, diced
- 6 cloves garlic, grated
- 1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes
- thyme
- bay leaf
- 2 eggplants, diced
- 3 squashes (e.g., zucchini, yellow squash), diced

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 450Â°F.
2. Roast peppers skin side up until skin loosens, about 15 minutes. Broil briefly to char. Transfer to a bowl and cover with foil to steam the peppers. Dice when cool.
3. Saute onion and garlic in a large skillet over low heat until very soft but not browned.
4. Add peppers, tomatoes, thyme, and bay leaf. Simmer on low heat.
5. In another skillet, saute eggplant with olive oil until softened. Add more olive oil as necessary. Reserve.
6. Use the now-empty skillet to saute squash with olive oil until softened. Add it and the reserved eggplant to the large skillet.
7. Simmer everything until most of the liquid has evaporated. Season with salt and pepper.

Serve with a [fried egg](fried-eggs.md) on top.

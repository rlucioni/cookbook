# Pistachio Gelato

Yields 1 quart.

## Ingredients

- 3 egg yolks
- 1/2 cup sugar (or 1/2 * 3/4 = 3/8 cup = 6 tablespoons corn syrup)
- 2 cups milk
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 6 tablespoons pistachio paste (e.g., Agrimontana, Fiddyment Farms)

## Instructions

1. Whisk together egg yolks and sugar (or corn syrup) in a pot. Whisk in milk, cream, and salt.
2. Set over medium heat and cook, whisking frequently, until the custard reaches 170&deg;F. Remove from heat and whisk in pistachio paste.
3. Strain custard into an airtight container. Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, a few hours to overnight. You can use an ice bath to speed up the process.
4. Pour chilled custard into a running ice cream maker. Churn until it's firm and a spoon run across the top leaves a lasting impression, about 20-30 minutes.
5. Transfer to a separate container and freeze until firm, usually a few hours.

Move to the refrigerator 10-15 minutes before scooping. Goes well served in a [pizzelle](pizzelles.md) garnished with chopped pistachios.

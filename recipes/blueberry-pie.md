# Blueberry Pie

For a 9.5" pie

## Ingredients

- 2 batches [pie crust](pie-crust.md)
- 2 1/2 - 3 pounds wild blueberries
- 1 granny smith apple, peeled, grated, and squeezed
- zest and juice of 1 lemon
- 2/3 cup sugar
- 2 tablespoons minute tapioca, ground (see [here](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/guides/pie-baking/pie-thickener.html) for alternatives)
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- heavy cream and demerara sugar for topping

## Instructions

1. Roll out one batch of pie crust, put it in the pie plate, and refrigerate.
2. Cook half of the blueberries on medium heat for 8-10 minutes, stirring and mashing occasionally. Let cool briefly.
3. Preheat oven to 400°F. Adjust the oven rack to the lowest position and place a foil-lined baking sheet on the rack to preheat.
4. Combine the rest of the filling ingredients in a large bowl. Add the cooked blueberries and mix thoroughly.
5. Roll out top crust. Add filling to prepared pie plate and top with top crust. Leave about 1/2 inch overhang of dough on all sides. Fold this overhang under itself and crimp to seal.
6. Cut venting slits in the top crust. Brush with cream and sprinkle with demerara sugar.
7. Bake for 30 minutes. Reduce heat to 350°F and continue to bake until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling, about 40 more minutes.

Chill pie thoroughly before slicing. Serve with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

# Stir Fry Noodles

## Ingredients

- 1/2 pound protein (pork, shrimp, egg, or similar)
- 1 small onion, sliced
- 1 bunch leafy greens (tatsoi, pea shoots, spinach, or similar), roughly chopped
- soy sauce
- rice noodles
- sesame oil
- scallions, chopped
- garlic powder

## Instructions

1. Heat pan on medium-high heat with some olive oil. Lightly season protein of choice and cook until almost done. Reserve.
2. Saute onions briefly. Add leafy greens and cook until wilted. Reserve.
3. Add water and soy sauce to pan. When liquids come to a boil, add rice noodles.
4. After rice noodles have softened a bit, cut in half using shears. Continue to cook until all the liquids have been absorbed. Add reserved vegetables and protein and cook until no liquid remains at the bottom of the pan.
5. Add sesame oil, scallions, and garlic powder. Stir fry until everything is cooked through and well-combined.

# Calzones

Adapted from [Chef John's calzones](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2015/07/youve-entered-calzone-zone.html).

## Ingredients

- [pizza dough](pan-pizza.md)
- 1/4 onion, sliced
- 1/2 bell pepper, sliced
- 2 Italian sausages, cooked and cut into bite-sized pieces
- 8 ounces mozzarella, sliced and dried
- fresh basil
- 1 egg beaten with some water
- Parmesan cheese for dusting
- corn meal
- [pizza sauce](pizza-sauce.md)

## Instructions

1. Prepare pizza dough. It has to rise overnight. If you want calzones today, start the dough yesterday.
2. Preheat oven to 500Â°F.
3. Divide dough in half. Roll out to an 8-9 inch diameter circle.
4. Layer sausage, vegetables, basil, and mozzarella on half the dough circle. Save the sauce for dipping unless you want soggy calzones.
5. Top with black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil.
6. Fold into calzone and crimp the edges. Cut three steam vents. Brush with egg wash and sprinkle over Parmesan cheese.
7. Place on foil-lined baking sheet sprinkled with corn meal.
8. Bake for 15 minutes.

Serve sauce on the side (e.g., in a ramekin).

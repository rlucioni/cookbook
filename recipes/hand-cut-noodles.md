# Hand-cut noodles

## Ingredients

- 250 grams all-purpose flour
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 115 grams water

## Instructions

1. Mix flour and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment. Mix on speed 2 while drizzling in water and mix for 2 minutes.
2. Use your hands to pack the dough together into a ball. You may have to add a tiny bit more water.
3. Continue to knead on speed 2 for 4 minutes, stopping halfway through to gather the dough by hand and any residual flour stuck to the sides of the bowl.
4. Form the dough into a ball. It should look cracked and a bit dry. Cover the bowl with a towel and let sit for 30 minutes.
5. Start bringing a large pot of water to a boil. Cut the dough in half and form one half into a rectangle. Roll it out into a long rectangle. To speed things up, flour both sides generously and roll the dough onto itself like a scroll and continue rolling.
6. Flour the sheet generously and fold in half and half again. Cut into noodles with a knife. Separate the noodles and dust with more flour to prevent sticking.
7. Roll and cut the other half of dough the same way. Boil noodles for 60-90 seconds to desired doneness.

Strain and serve immediately with soup or toss with a sauce.

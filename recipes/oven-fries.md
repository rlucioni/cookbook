# Oven Fries

## Ingredients

- 4 russet potatoes (6-8 oz each), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch thick planks
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1 teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Adjust oven rack to lowest position. Preheat to 450Â°F.
2. Put cut potatoes in bowl, cover with plastic, and microwave 3-5 minutes until translucent around edges. Reserve on paper towel lined plate.
3. Generously coat rimmed baking sheet with oil. Heat in oven until just smoking, about 5 minutes.
4. Whisk oil, cornstarch, and salt in a bowl to make a slurry. Toss potatoes in it to coat.
5. Arrange potatoes in a single layer on the baking sheet. Bake until golden brown and crispy, about 35 minutes. Flip potatoes about halfway through. Drain on paper towel lined plate.

Potatoes can stick to the foil-lined baking sheet as they cool. Move them around as soon as they come out of the oven to avoid this.

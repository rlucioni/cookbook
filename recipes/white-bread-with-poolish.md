From Ken Forkish's Flour Water Salt Yeast. Schedule: mix poolish at 7 PM, mix final dough at 9 AM, proof at 12 PM, bake at 1 PM, done around 1:45 PM.

## Ingredients

### Poolish

- 250 grams all-purpose flour
- 1/16 teaspoon instant yeast
- 250 grams water, 90-95°F

### Final dough

- 250 grams all-purpose flour
- 11 grams salt (about 2 scant teaspoons)
- 1.5 grams instant yeast (about 3/8 teaspoon)
- 125 grams water, 90-95°F

## Instructions

1. Mix poolish. Mix flour and yeast, then mix in water. Let sit at room temperature 12-14 hours.
2. Mix final dough. Mix flour, salt, and yeast. Pour water around perimeter of poolish, loosen from tub, then pour water and poolish into flour mixture. Mix, alternating folding with pincer method. Let rise 3 hours.
3. Fold. Dough needs 3 folds 20 minutes apart during the first hour of rising. Each time, wet your hand, reach underneath dough, grab about a quarter, then gently stretch and fold it over top to other side of dough. Repeat 4-5 times, then flip dough over and let it rest. Once all folds are done, cover dough and let rest.
4. Shape then proof for 1 hour.
5. Preheat. About 30 minutes before baking, put Dutch oven on a middle oven rack and preheat to 475°F.
6. Bake! Invert proofed loaf onto a lightly floured countertop. Take Dutch oven out, place loaf in seam-side up, cover, and put it in the oven. Bake 35 minutes, then uncover and bake for another 10 minutes until dark brown.

Take Dutch oven out, tilt out loaf, and let cool on a rack 20 minutes before slicing.

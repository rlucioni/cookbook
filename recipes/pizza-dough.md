# Pizza Dough

Makes two 10" pizzas.

## Ingredients

- 400 grams bread flour
- 280 grams water, 90-95°F
- 8 grams salt
- scant 1/8 teaspoon instant yeast

## Instructions

1. Autolyse. Mix flour and water by hand until incorporated. Cover and let rest 30 minutes.
2. Mix. Sprinkle salt and yeast evenly over top of dough. Wet your hand, reach underneath dough, grab about a quarter, then gently stretch and fold it over top to other side of dough. Repeat several times until salt and yeast are enclosed. To fully mix ingredients, use your thumb and forefinger to make pincer cuts through dough. Then fold dough over itself a few times. Repeat, cutting and folding until ingredients are well mixed and dough has some tension to it. Let dough rest for a few minutes, then fold another 30 seconds or until dough tightens up. Target dough temp at this point is 77-78°F. Cover and let rise 12-14 hours or until it's tripled in size.
3. [Fold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQHuWDEo3SA). Dough needs 2 folds 30 minutes apart during the first hour of rising. Each time, wet your hand, reach underneath dough, grab about a quarter, then gently stretch and fold it over top to other side of dough. Repeat 4-5 times, then flip dough over and let it rest. Once both folds are done, cover dough and let it rest overnight until the dough is 2-3 times its original volume, about 12 hours.
4. Divide and shape. Cut the dough into 2 equal pieces and shape each into a tight dough ball.
5. Proof. Place dough balls on a lightly floured plate or baking sheet. Sprinkle the tops with flour, cover, and let proof in the refrigerator at least 6 hours or up to 2 days.

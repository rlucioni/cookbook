# Pita Bread

Adapted from [Chef John's pita bread](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2013/04/pita-bread-whats-in-your-pocket.html). Makes 8 pitas.

## Ingredients

- 385 grams all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 240 grams water, 90-95Â°F
- 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil

## Instructions

1. Whisk together flour, yeast, and salt. Stir in water and olive oil until everything comes together.
2. Knead for 6 minutes, with a machine and dough hook if possible.
3. Lightly oil dough's surface, then let rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours.
4. Remove to a floured surface. Press down with hands, then cut into 8 pieces. Form small, round loaves and let proof 30 minutes, covered.
5. Heat a cast iron or nonstick skillet, lightly painted with oil, on medium heat. Roll out loaves into 1/4-1/8" thick rounds. Let rest a few minutes, then grill loaves until they puff and turn golden brown, about 3 minutes. When a bubble forms, lightly press down on it with your spatula to make it puff faster.

# Churros

Inspired by Chocolateria San Gines in Madrid

## Ingredients

### Dough

- 1 cup water
- 1/2 cup butter
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 160 grams all-purpose flour
- 3 eggs, beaten
- vegetable oil
- open star piping tip (Wilton 1M)

### Hot Chocolate

- 4 ounces dark chocolate
- 2 cups milk
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 4 tablespoons sugar

## Instructions

1. Heat oil to 360Â°F.
2. Bring water, butter, and salt to a boil in a saucepan. Add flour and stir vigorously over low heat until mixture forms a ball, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Slowly stir in beaten eggs.
3. Spoon mixture into a piping bag with star tip. Squeeze 4-inch strips of dough into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown, turning once, about 2 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.
4. Mix chocolate and half the milk in a saucepan over low heat until chocolate melts. Dissolve cornstarch in the remaining milk, then whisk it and the sugar into the chocolate. Cook over low heat, whisking constantly, until chocolate is thick and smooth, about 5 minutes.

Pour chocolate into cups and serve with churros.

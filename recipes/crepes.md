# Crepes

Yields 9-10 crepes

## Ingredients

- 1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil
- 5 ounces all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon table salt
- 1 1/2 cups whole milk
- 3 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in 12-inch skillet over low heat for about 10 minutes.
2. Whisk together flour, sugar, and salt. In separate bowl, whisk together milk, eggs, and butter. Whisk into dry ingredients until smooth.
3. Wipe out skillet with paper towel to leave a thin film of oil. Increase heat to medium. A teaspoon of batter cooked for 20 seconds should yield a golden brown mini crepe.
4. Pour 1/3 cup batter into far side of pan. Tilt and shake until batter evenly covers bottom of pan. Cook crepe without moving it until top surface is dry and crepe starts to brown at edges, loosening crepe from side of pan with rubber spatula, about 25 seconds. Gently slide spatula underneath edge of crepe, grab edge with fingertips, and flip. Cook until second side is lightly spotted, about 20 seconds. Transfer cooked crepe to wire rack, inverting so spotted side is facing up. Return pan to heat for 10 seconds before repeating with remaining batter. As crepes are done, stack on wire rack.

Goes great with briefly microwaved Nutella spread on top half of crepe with banana slices on top. Fold into quarters!

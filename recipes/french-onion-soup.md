# French Onion Soup

Serves 4.

## Ingredients

- 3 pounds yellow onions, sliced pole to pole (through the root end)
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 3/4 cup water
- 1/8 teaspoon baking soda
- 2 sprigs thyme
- 1 bay leaf
- 1/4 cup dry sherry wine
- 4 cups beef stock
- 1 cup chicken stock
- sherry vinegar, to taste
- crusty bread, cubed
- Gruy√®re cheese, grated

## Instructions

1. Add onions, oil, salt, and water to a pot over medium-high heat. When the water reaches a boil, cover and cook until water is evaporated, about 10 minutes. Onions should have collapsed significantly.
2. Stir onions every 30 seconds or so until they're browned and soft, about 15-20 minutes.
3. Mix baking soda with 1 tablespoon water. Stir into onions and wait for water to evaporate.
4. Add thyme, bay leaf, black pepper, sherry, and stock. Simmer for 15 minutes. Add sherry vinegar (optional). Ladle into oven-proof bowls.
5. Fry bread cubes in olive oil until golden brown and crunchy. Float croutons on soup and top with cheese. Melt cheese under broiler.

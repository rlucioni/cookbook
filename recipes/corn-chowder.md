# Corn Chowder

Serves 4.

## Ingredients

- 4 strips thick cut bacon, diced
- 2 large leeks, cleaned and coarsely chopped
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 1 cup whole milk
- 3 cups chicken stock
- 2 Yukon Gold potatoes, cubed
- 8-10 ears corn
- 1 tablespoon chopped fire-roasted green chiles

## Instructions

1. Cook bacon on medium heat until brown and most of the fat is rendered. Reserve bacon bits.
2. Add leeks to bacon fat and sweat until soft.
3. Add flour and cook 2 minutes. Then mix in milk and chicken stock. Bring to a simmer.
4. Add potatoes and cook until almost tender, about 10-15 minutes.
5. Cut the corn kernels off the cobs and use the back of the knife to scrape the residual corn pulp from the cobs. Add all the corn and pulp to the soup.
6. Immersion blend briefly to blend some of the corn. Add green chiles.
7. Cook another 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Serve with tortilla chips and garnish with bacon bits.
